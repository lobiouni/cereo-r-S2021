Processing and analysis of bike data.

Notes for the CEREO / CIRC R Workshop Spring 2021

My personal goals for this workshop:

1. Seamlessly use git to update during a workshop;
2. Create some interesting figures looking at the bike data and explore the relationship between temperature and number of riders.
